Version 0.1.19
==============

Lot of changes since the last release - many of them are internal but
as a user you should notice that there are no docked forms anymore
they were getting on my nerves. And that the properties should be
available from the edit screen rather than a separate form.

The treeBrowser now has a list and edit pane on it

there are new types of attributes:
			Numeric (Not enforced yet), 
			url (no value yet)
			Set (a user defined list, each item in the list on a different line)
			Date (enforced)
		
check the compdev database to see how I have started using these on 
defects and requirements

saving of the list screen to excel so you can do all your defect analysis in there

general GUI tidying up.

by the way, I am using the old VB package builder as a quick fix- I do plan
to use a proper installer at some point but it does mean that the download
is a rather large file now.

also the loose files in the install package (dbdefns.txt, etc.) should be
placed in your application directory.

Enjoy,
