<h1>Version Tracking Report 0.1.21</h1>
The main purpose of this release is to:<br>
o add reporting, via scripting<br>
o custom reports for defect reporting and version tracking<br>
o to change the load entity defn from database mechanism and interface<br>
o remove the window less controls and rtf control from the project<br>
<br>
This has been added and will form the basis of the baselined project for version 1.<br>
<br>
I will now be entering the document/test/debug phase. This will obviously entail a few extra functional additions but they will be minor.<br>
<br>
