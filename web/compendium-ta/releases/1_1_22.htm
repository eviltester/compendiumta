<td>delete entity defn implemented</td>
<td>for some reason I thought I had implemented this when in fact all I had done was implement the delete entity defn attribute defn.<br>
<br>
Now I have implemented entitydefn delete&nbsp</td>

<tr>
<td>15/10/2003 14:16:07</td>
<td>Changed Persistence Mechanism save</td>
<td>Changed the save part of the persistence mechanism, this will be transparent to the user but will lead to future benefits in terms of adding more persistence mechanisms faster.&nbsp</td>
<td>12&nbsp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>28/10/2003 09:20:34</td>
<td>changed naming of new entity defn</td>
<td>new entityDefn were all called default, changed this so the id is used as part of the name&nbsp</td>

<tr>
<td>09/11/2003 17:37:18</td>
<td>added dynamic population of tree browser</td>
<td>the tree browser now displays dynamically so it should be alittle faster and less prone to any possible latency errors.&nbsp</td>
<td>4&nbsp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10/11/2003 10:38:46</td>
<td>changed observer code for tree browser delete</td>
<td>The tree browser now no longer refreshes the whole tree when deleting an item in the tree - partly due to the dynamic population. and the tree maintains a level of expansion when an item is deleted - this feels faster, cleaner and more user friendly.&nbsp</td>
<td>1&nbsp</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10/11/2003 13:57:30</td>
<td>made hierarchy browser dynamic display</td>
<td>The hierarchy browser now loads the tree as required. This really increases the speed of loading the hierarchy when it is large.<br>
<br>
I also changed the refresh code on the tree so it should maintain its shape a bit better.&nbsp</td>
