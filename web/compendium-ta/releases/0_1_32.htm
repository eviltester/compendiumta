The install routine has been completely changed so that all the files are clean, MDAC and JET are not installed, the system checks for them and if not installed prompts the user to go off and download them.<br>

This has been tested using virtual PC on win98, win98SE, winNT4SP3, winNT4SP4&nbsp</td>
