<td>drag and drop between models</td>
<td>The Test Analyst Edition can now drag and drop between models.<br>
<br>
Entity Instances can be dragged from one model to another if an entity of the same name exists in both models. The entity instance is copied as well as can be so the name, url, description are copied; any weightings which are the same are copied; any attachments are copied.<br>
<br>
Hierarchical structures can be dragged.<br>
<br>
If an entity instance is embedded in a hierarchy then it is copied across based on the rules above. Note: The system first tries to identify the entity instance in the existing model first so if an intance with the same name, url, desc and weightings already exists then this will be used as a branch reference rather than the copied in reference (because they are so similar as to be almost the same)<br>
