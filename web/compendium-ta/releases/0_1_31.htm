<td>extend goto tab to show structural relationships</td>
<td>The goto tab now shows structural relationships. <br>
<br>
These are internal model relationships which are used for navigating around the model. These can be identified in the list as the Type name starts with [].<br>
<br>
If the item is in:<br>
 a hierarchy then []Hierarchy refers to a hierarchy that it is in. <br>
 a graph then []Graph refers to the graph<br>
 a path then []Path refers to the path<br>
<br>
if the item is a:<br>
 node then the outlinks and inlinks are displayed<br>
 link then the from node and to node are displayed<br>
 entity instance then the entity is displayed<br>
<br>
Double clicking on the item will open the edit dialog for the structurally related item. If it is a hierarchy then the hierarchy will be positioned at the item branch.<br>
