<h1>Version Tracking Report 1.1.30</h1>
Bug fixes and minor requirements implemented. <br>
<br>
The big feature of this release is filtering of the grids which is a major boon when there are many records.<br>

<br>
from here it is possible to create a filter [define filter], stop the current display from being filtered [clear filter], delete a definition of a filter, apply a filter, or edit the current filter [edit filter]<br>
<br>
Filters are persisted to the database when saving the model.<br>
<br>
The text filters use regular expressions, as defined by the VBscript regex command.<br>
<br>
This will be explained in the help file at some point, if this is released without the help file being updated then more information can be found at http://www.microsoft.com/scripting under the vbscript documentation links<br>
<br>
or more specifically here where the pattern property is defined<br>
<br>
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/script56/html/vspropattern.asp<br>
<br>
This functionality requires VBScript to be installed at version 5 or greater. The system checks for this at start up and prompts the user with download links if it is not found. (most people already have it installed)&nbsp</td>

When selected, the instances will be displayed under the entity definition in the Model Browser.<br>
When not selected the instances are not displayed.<br>
<br>
I have found that when the instances are many, the browser then becomes unweildy and I end up using the lists to display the instances and working from there.<br>
<br>
I have added this as a configurable item in case some people do like working with the instances in the model browser.&nbsp</td>

27/11/2003 17:50:56<br>
Now that the instances can be turned off from the model browser, I no longer use this method of working with instances. While siblings would be better, the parent entity defn is used so the problem is not as bad as it was.<br>

i recommend the lists for maintaining the instances as it is much more convenient. Particularly with filters.&nbsp</td>
