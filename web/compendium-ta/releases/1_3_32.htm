<h1>Version Tracking Report 1.3.34</h1>
Intended as a GUI enhancement release, changing the attributes/description/weightings to be a property view and adding easier xref drag and drop.<br>
<br>
Also contains a critical bug fix.<br>
<br>
was version 1.3.32 - moved up to version 1.3.34 with the addition of a fix to the Set weightings display (the properties dialog displayed an error message when a value was present in a set instance field that wasn't part of the set). [2E2F85F7-B009-4DDF-9674-9C812822B9D3]<br>

<td>Changed the Edit Pane</td>
<td>The edit pane has been changed to use the properties list control.<br>
<br>
This allows all the attributes, the description, the weightings, attachments, relationships and gotos to be maintained from a single tab instead of switching tabs.<br>
<br>
Also the weightings can be edited in situ in the list instead of having to jump to a separate tab.<br>
<br>
This should make the GUI run faster and be easier to use.<br>

<td>configurable text edit field</td>
<td>The old edit pane had a fixed position for the edit field since it was on a tab.<br>
<br>
The new edit pane allows you to globally configure the position and attributes for the edit pane under &quot;edit  view&quot;.<br>
<br>
The text pane can be configured to only show when a string item is selected (the description or a String weighting) or be displayed all the time 'Constantly Display Descriptions Memo Field'<br>
<br>
The global position of the edit field can be controlled by the 3 options <br>
<br>
insitu position<br>
graph node/link<br>
generic position<br>
<br>
these refer to the contexts in which the edit pane is shown.<br>
<br>
insitu position is when the edit pane is nested in a form, e.g. the tree browser or the main edit properties in the graph or path edit.<br>
<br>
'graph node/link' refers to the graph node, and link insitu editor in the graph edit form.<br>
<br>
generic position is when the object is being edited in a form on its own.<br>
<br>
These defaults can be manually overridden in the edit form itself with the two icons on the properties list 'show/hide editor' which is a toggle button and controls the display of the text editor.<br>
<br>
and the editor position button which displays a drop down menu allowing you to choose the position to display the editor (either on the top, left, right or bottom) relative to the properties list.<br>
<br>
The editor can also be sized by using the splitter between the editor and the properties list.&nbsp</td>

<br>
Have also created full install versions for win95 and 98NT, XP2000.<br>
<br>
Have also created a version with the app and the VBruntimes (same as XP2000 actually)<br>

The online one is recommended as it is only a little larger than the minimal install but will act as a full install for the user operating system&nbsp</td>

Investigation (fri 07/05/04) cannot replicate<br>
<br>
Investigation (sat 08/05/04) replicate but cannot consistently replicate<br>
<br>
Investigation (mon 10/05/04) replication steps:<br>
- create new model in new database<br>
- create a graph<br>
- add 2 nodes to the graph, link the two nodes<br>
- close graph edit<br>
- select node in hierarchy<br>
- convert node to be a node tree<br>
- 50% of the time the system will freeze<br>
<br>
This defect can not be replicated in the IDE and is only present in the compiled version.<br>

&nbsp</td>
<td>Added tracing code throughout observer loop.

Error occured in a function to loop through a list refreshing the items.

It was not an infinite loop, the system appeared to crash on the first statement of a for each looping through the list view.

Have no idea at all why this should prove problematic as no error was raised, the system freezes.

Have rewritten the code to defensively check for error states and changed from a for each to a for next using an index.

Replication steps no longer cause system to freeze
