<h1>Version Tracking Report 1.2.5</h1>
Because the internals have been so radically altered and the front end is now much more streamlined with new persistence options. I have upped the version to 1.2<br>

<td>The application has an option for 'Incremental Update' where model items are saved to the database as soon as a change happens.<br>
<br>
When using this mode, it is important to save the model to the database before turning this option on, otherwise changes made to the model before incremental update was switched on may not be saved&nbsp</td>

Consistency has been applied so that the properties icon always opens the object properties, and when it is a graph or path the [edit graph] icon is available as well.&nbsp</td>

<tr>
<td>06/02/2004 12:03:59</td>
<td>View Nodes as trees</td>
<td>rather than adding functionality to convert graphs to hierarchies, which is somewhat problematical. I have added Node Trees functionality.<br>
<br>
This allows nodes to be viewed in the hierarchy under a new branch 'Node Trees'. Nodes can be expanded here as though they were hierarchies and the from links out of the node traversed.<br>
<br>
This can be controlled via the app properties in a number of ways.<br>
<br>
All nodes can be viewed as node trees. Or just those nodes which have been marked as node trees (using the button in the edit properties).<br>
<br>
App Properties controls wether the links are displayed in the node tree hierarchy, and also if the node tree stops when the first duplicate node is found or if it is recursively displayed.<br>
<br>
<br>
i.e for this kind of set up 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 would be displayed as<br>
1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 when recursion is off<br>
and as 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 if recursion is on.<br>
<br>
This is why the expand tree button only expands down a single level rather than expanding the whole tree&nbsp</td>

<td>In situ Graphical Node Link Properties Edit</td>

<br>
This was done to improve the usability and to fix a defect where the system would shutdown under some circumstances when the old graphical properties dialog was open and focus moved to a different application.&nbsp</td>

This can be configured to check when the application starts up or can be initiated manually from the help menu.<br>
<br>
All this function does is check fo a file on the CompendiumDev web site and read the application version number contained in it.<br>

<br>
WinGraphViz is available from http://home.so-net.net.tw/oodtsen/wingraphviz/ <br>
<br>
Use of the dll results in slightly different output but the generation is faster as no temporary files are created.<br>

<td>Text box templates are those things that pop up when you type ctrl+Ins in a text box.<br>
<br>
I thought I'd make it easier to customise that and bring that functionality more to the fold so I have added an internal editor for the text box templates, this is on the edit menu.<br>
<br>
I will at some point change the storage of these templates and this internal editor now allows me to change the backend without most users noticing.&nbsp</td>

The graphviz framework is changing all the time so I have 3 paths<br>
dot.exe<br>
neato.exe<br>
twopi.exe<br>

use directed     -&gt; dotPath   or wingraphviz.dot<br>
use undirected -&gt; neatoPath   or wingraphviz.neato <br>
use  circular)  -&gt; twopiPath   or wingraphviz.twopi<br>
<br>
This allows you to use more experimental dot tools e.g. circo.exe by pointing one of the paths to it.<br>
