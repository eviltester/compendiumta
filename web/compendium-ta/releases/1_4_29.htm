<td>09/06/2004 16:45:40</td>
<td>added user defined icons</td>
<td>If an icon (.ico) file with the same name as the entity is placed in the icons directory then it will be displayed instead of the generic entityInstance Symbol.<br>
<br>
Then icons directory is:<br>
{appPath}\entities\icons<br>
<br>
so an icon for defect entities would be in<br>
{appPath}\entities\icons\defect.ico<br>
<br>
the icons should be 16x16 with 16 colour.<br>
<br>
This is the same format used for favicon on web sites so you might want to have a look at http://www.1stsitefree.com/howcani/favicon.htm which lists tools and sources of icons.&nbsp</td>

<td>use of temp file instead of clipboard</td>
<td>The clipboard was used as a temporary storage point for graphics for graphs when doing the sitemap export and when saving as bmp and jpg etc.<br>
<br>
This has been fixed to use temporary files instead.<br>
<br>
I have also moved some of the code to do this out to a dll as part of the general CTA refactoring.&nbsp</td>

<td>added case sensitivity to find</td>
<td>The find code has been refactored and introduced a split between GUI and model.<br>
<br>
In the process I have added a case sensitivity checkbox to the searching so you can check it to enforce case checking in the search. <br>
<br>
The default is case insensitive.&nbsp</td>

<td>removed tooltips from insitu text edit</td>
<td>When the description field is being edited. or a string weighting. The tooltips for the edit field were set to the name of the field.<br>
<br>
This was redundant since the label tell s you what field it is, and actually got in the way.<br>
<br>
So I removed this code.&nbsp</td>

<tr>
<td>20/06/2004 12:40:46</td>
<td>investigate time drop down</td>
<td>the time drop down on weightings, when the user types in a time value quickly and presses return, is not saved.<br>
<br>
I did some investigation into this and it turns out that the microsoft date time control has a pause before triggering the change event when the values are changed by using the numeric buttons, as opposed to the up down buttons (which trigger a change instantly) this is because there has to be a gap before verifying the data that is typed in, i.e if the change was triggered immediately then when I type 4, it would be registerd as a 4 then if I typed 5 it would be registered as a 5 instead of the 45 that was desired.<br>
<br>
I have added functionality to underline the ok in the ok button when the change event is triggered, this means that when you type 4, the underline on ok will not be shown, but when the change event is triggered so that the value is now part of the data, the underline will be shown and changes will be made to the date value.<br>
<br>
sounds complicated but when you see it in action it will make sense.&nbsp</td>

<td>splitting system in to dlls</td>
<td>work is underway to move the system from a single .exe into a main .exe with dlls, this will ease the transition to a pluggable addin architecture.<br>
<br>
This is a long term plan and may take some time before it is complete.<br>
<br>
currently split into dlls for filehandling, online update, tool management, string handling.<br>
<br>
This will also ease the creation of unit test harnesses.&nbsp</td>
