<h1>Version Tracking Report 1.4.38</h1>

<td>The API has a new item<br>
<br>
theGUI<br>
<br>
e.g. cdiface.theGUI<br>
<br>
which has the following functions:<br>
<br>
EditObject <br>
EditObjectProperties<br>
EditAsHierarchy<br>
toggleAppBar<br>
<br>
all of the will take any valid Compendium-TA object but will only open a window if it is valid for the function.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
editObject will mainly open a properties window but for a graph or a path will open the editGraph and editPath dialogs.<br>
<br>
EditObjectProperties will open a properties window to edit the object<br>
<br>
EditAsHierarchy will display the object in a new hierarchy window if it can be displayed in such i.e. a hierarchy branch, a hierarchy, a graph<br>
<br>
usage would be:<br>
<br>
cdiface.theGUI.editObject  anObject<br>
cdiface.theGUI.EditObjectProperties anObject<br>
cdiface.theGUI.EditAsHierarchy anObject<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
toggleAppBar will toggle the application control panel on or off. With no arguments it is a toggle, with a value of true it will show the application control panel and with a value of false it will hide the application control panel<br>
<br>
e.g.<br>
<br>
cdiface.theGUI.toggleAppBar<br>
cdiface.theGUI.toggleAppBar true<br>
cdiface.theGUI.toggleAppBar false<br>
