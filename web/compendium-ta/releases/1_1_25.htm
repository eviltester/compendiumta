<br>

<td>added auto backup functionality</td>
<td>Added functionality into the system to allow for auto backing up of the model on save.<br>
<br>
This is done by zipping up the database to a zip file.<br>
<br>
The configuration of this is done on the Edit\App Properties menu and the backups can be transparent or the user prompted, the time between backups (measured in saves) is configurable.  As is the number of backup files to maintain.<br>
<br>
This is also added in to the database upgrade function as well so a backup zip is made as well as a direct copy.<br>

It is far better to save the ini details when they change so the save is now carried out when the edit\app properties form is closed.&nbsp</td>

quick pick list click on model - should say that model is loaded, but reloads from database (Becuase it has a different name)<br>
should be working off the GUID&nbsp</td>
<td>With the new peristence mechanism, this defect became more serious.

It was low/low but now, it was possible to open the model twice, close the second copy and then not be able to save the first copy because the mapping had gone.

The loading code has been changed to check for the guid or the name.

I have also added the [] dynamic model display checkbox in edit\app properties to turn on or off the dynamic functionality.

It does appear to work now but it can be switched off by the user if required.&nbsp</td>
