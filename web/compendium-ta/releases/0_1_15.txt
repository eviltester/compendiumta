There are 2 new dlls in the system folder now

dbdefn.txt should reside in the same directory as the program exe if you want to create any new databases.


added a "File" type weighting which can point to a file and open the file
		for referencing specs, test data etc.
		added this to nodes, links, entities

added a node word processor and a link word processor on graph edit - this allows the user to edit
	        all the links and/or all the nodes at the same time. This is a more comfortable way of editing
		when "auto prompt for edit" is off and the graph is filling the edit dialog - at least for me 
		it is!


added dataaccess objects - I think this has resulted in a new DLL DAO36

fixed problem with loading models with fields defined (didn't account for old models not having the field type)

fixed template combo failing when no template found as default

added save to database code on normal saveToFile

added load to memory from database

added create database from text file functionality

added createDatabase, connect to database, close database, load from database as separate menu options

added save model to database option separate from normal file save

compared save and load from file to save and load from database - seems ok

save model dialog retitled

node name not allowed to be edited to blank

path properties dialog accessible from path dialog
the graph toolbar expand in tab only mode is above, and not on, the tab

open database file dialog no longer a "save as" dialog

added default draw style to the addflow graphs
- same mechanism will chang the style of the selected links

added import entity from database function - from other models

added toolbar to the model browser with *some* functions

added the "fake docking" functionality to the model browser - this will bring the details of the 
	selected item to the right of the model browser when the node is selected. They can be 
	"undocked" by using the normal editing functionality.
